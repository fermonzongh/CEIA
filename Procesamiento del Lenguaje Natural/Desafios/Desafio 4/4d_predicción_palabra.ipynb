I\\'m standing up, I\\'mma face my demons I\\'m manning up, I\\'mma hold my ground I\\'ve had enough, now I\\'m so fed up Time to put my life back together right now (now) It was my decision to get clean, I did it for me Admittedly, I probably did it subliminally For you, so I could come back a brand new me, you helped see me through And don\\'t realize what you did, believe me you I been through the ringer, but they could do little to the middle finger I think I got a tear in my eye, I feel like the king of My world, haters can make like bees with no stingers and drop dead No more bee flingers, no more drama from now on I promise to focus solely on handlin\\' my responsibilities as a father So I solemnly swear to always treat this roof, like my daughters and raise it You couldn\\'t lift a single shingle on it, \\'cause the way I feel I\\'m strong enough to go to the club or the corner pub And lift the whole liquor counter up \\'cause I\\'m raising the bar I\\'d shoot for the moon but I\\'m too busy gazin\\' at stars, I feel amazing and I\\'m not I\\'m not afraid (I\\'m not afraid) To take a stand (to take a stand) Everybody (Everybody) Come take my hand come (Come take my hand) We\\'ll walk this road together, through the storm Whatever weather, cold or warm Just letting you know that, you\\'re not alone Holla if you feel like you\\'ve been down the same road Just gonna stand there and watch me burn But that\\'s alright, because I like the way it hurts Just gonna stand there and hear me cry But that\\'s alright, because I love the way you lie I love the way you lie I can\\'t tell you what it really is I can only tell you what it feels like And right now there\\'s a steel knife, in my windpipe I can\\'t breathe, but I still fight, while I can fight As long as the wrong feels right, it\\'s like I\\'m in flight High off of love drunk from my hate It\\'s like I\\'m huffing paint and I love it the more that I suffer I suffocate and right before I\\'m about to drown She resuscitates me, she fucking hates me, And I love it, wait Where you going, I\\'m leaving you No you ain\\'t, come back We\\'re running right back, here we go again It\\'s so insane \\'cause when it\\'s going good, it\\'s going great I\\'m Superman, with the wind at his back, she\\'s Lois Lane But when it\\'s bad, it\\'s awful I feel so ashamed, I snapped, who\\'s that dude I don\\'t even know his name, I laid hands on her I\\'ll never stoop so low again, I guess I don\\'t know my own strength Just gonna stand there and watch me burn But that\\'s alright, because I like the way it hurts Just gonna stand there and hear me cry But that\\'s alright, because I love the way you lie I love the way you lie I love the way you lie You ever love somebody so much You can barely breathe, when you\\'re with them, you meet And neither one of you, even know what hit \\'em, Got that warm fuzzy feeling, yeah them chills, used to get \\'em Now you\\'re getting fucking sick, of looking at \\'em You swore you\\'ve never hit \\'em, never do nothing to hurt \\'em, Now you\\'re in each others face, Spewing venom, and these words, when you spit \\'em You push, pull each other\\'s hair, scratch, claw, bit \\'em, Throw \\'em down, pin \\'em, so lost in the moments, when you\\'re in \\'em It\\'s the rage that\\'s the culprit, it controls you both So they say it\\'s best, to go your separate ways, Guess that they don\\'t know ya \\'cause today, that was yesterday Yesterday is over, it\\'s a different day Sound like broken records, playin\\' over, but you promised her Next time you\\'ll show restraint You don\\'t get another chance, Life is no Nintendo game, but you lied again Now you get to watch her leave, Out the window, guess that\\'s why they call it window pane Just gonna stand there and watch me burn But that\\'s alright, because I like the way it hurts Just gonna stand there and hear me cry But that\\'s alright, because I love the way you lie I love the way you lie I love the way you lie Now I know we said things, did things That we didn\\'t mean and we fall back into the same patterns Same routine, but your temper\\'s just as bad, as mine is You\\'re the same as me, but when it comes to love, you\\'re just as blinded Baby please come back, it wasn\\'t you, Baby it was me, maybe our relationship isn\\'t as crazy as it seems Maybe that\\'s what happens When a tornado meets a volcano All I know is I love you too much, to walk away now Come inside, pick up your bags off the sidewalk Don\\'t you hear sincerity, in my voice when I talk, Told you this is my fault, look me in the eyeball Next time I\\'m pissed, I\\'ll aim my fist at the dry wall Next time, there will be no next time I apologize even though I know it\\'s lies I\\'m tired of the games, I just want her back, I know I\\'m a liar If she ever tries to fucking leave again I\\'m a tie her to the bed and set this house on fire Just gonna stand there and watch me burn But that\\'s alright, because I like the way it hurts Just gonna stand there and hear me cry But that\\'s alright, because I love the way you lie I love the way you lie I love the way you lie [Bruno Mars] This one\\'s for

I can\\'t find mommy, where is she?\" \"I don\\'t know, go play, Hailie baby, your daddy\\'s busy Daddy\\'s writing a song, this song ain\\'t gon write itself\" I give you one underdog, and you gotta swing by yourself Then turn right around in that song and tell her you love her And put hands on her mother who\\'s the spittin\\' image of her That\\'s Slim Shady, yeah baby Slim Shady\\'s crazy Shady made me But tonight, Shady\\'s rock-a-bye baby And when I\\'m gone just carry on don\\'t mourn, Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice, just know that, I\\'m lookin\\' down on you smilin\\' And I didn\\'t feel a thing so baby, don\\'t feel no pain, just smile back And when I\\'m gone just carry on don\\'t mourn, Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice, just know that, I\\'m lookin\\' down on you smilin\\' And I didn\\'t feel a thing so baby, don\\'t feel no pain, just smile back I keep havin\\' this dream, I\\'m pushin\\' Hailie on a swing, she keeps screamin\\', she don\\'t want me to sing \"You\\'re makin\\' mommy cry, why, why is mommy cryin\\'\" \"Baby, daddy ain\\'t leavin\\' no more, Daddy you\\'re lyin\\' You always say that, you always say this is the last time But you ain\\'t leavin\\' no more daddy, you\\'re mine\" She\\'s pilin\\' boxes in front of the door tryin\\' to block it \"Daddy please, daddy, don\\'t leave, daddy, no, stop it\" Goes in her pocket, pulls out a tiny necklace locket It\\'s got a picture, \"This will keep you safe daddy, take it with ya\" I look up, it\\'s just me standin\\' in the mirror These fuckin\\' walls must be talkin\\', \\'cause man I can hear \\'em They\\'re sayin\\', \"you got one more chance to do right And it\\'s tonight, now go out and show em that you love \\'em before it\\'s too late\" And just as I go to walk out of my bedroom door It turns to a stage, they\\'re gone and the spotlight is on and I\\'m singin\\' And when I\\'m gone just carry on don\\'t mourn, Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice, just know that, I\\'m lookin\\' down on you smilin\\' And I didn\\'t feel a thing so baby, don\\'t feel no pain, just smile back And when I\\'m gone just carry on don\\'t mourn, Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice, just know that, I\\'m lookin\\' down on you smilin\\' And I didn\\'t feel a thing so baby, don\\'t feel no pain, just smile back Sixty thousand people all jumpin\\' out their seat The curtain closes, they\\'re throwin\\' roses at my feet I take a bow, and thank you all for comin out They\\'re screamin\\' so loud, I take one last look at the crowd I glance down, I don\\'t believe what I\\'m seein\\' \"Daddy, its me, help mommy, her wrists are bleedin\\'\" But baby we\\'re in Sweden How did you get to Sweden? \"I followed you daddy You told me that you weren\\'t leavin\\' You lied to me dad, and now you made mommy sad And I bought you this coin, it says number one dad That\\'s all I wanted, I just want to give you this coin\" \"I get the point, fine, me and mommy are goin\\'\" \"But baby wait, it\\'s too late dad, you made your choice Now go out there and show em that you love em more than us That\\'s what they want They want you, Marshall They keep screamin\\' your name It\\'s no wonder you can\\'t go to sleep Just take another pill, yeah I bet you you will!

Oh, I didn\\'t feel special when I was with you All I ever felt was this Helplessness Imprisoned by a selfish bitch Chew me up and spit me out I fell for this so many times Its ridiculous And still I stick with this I\\'m sick of this but in my sickness and addiction Your as addictive as they get Evil as they come vindictive as they make \\'em My friends keep asking why I cant just walk away I\\'m addicted To the pain, the stress, the drama I\\'m drown in so I guess I\\'m a mess Cursed and blessed But this time I\\'m a Ain\\'t changing my mind I\\'m climbing out this abyss You screaming as I walk out that I\\'ll be missed But when you spoke to people who meant the most to you You left me off your list Fuck you hip-hop I\\'m leaving you, my life sentence is served bitch And its just Too late for the other side Caught in a chase Twenty five to life Too late for the other side Caught in a chase Twenty five to life Too late Caught in a change Twenty five to life Feels like a close, it\\'s coming to Fuck am I gonna do? It\\'s too late to start over This is the only thing I, thing I know Sometimes I feel like all I ever do is Find different ways to word the same, old song Ever since I came along From the day the song called \\'\\'Hi! My Name Is\\'\\' dropped Started thinking my name was fault \\'Cause anytime things went wrong I was the one who they would blame it on The media made me the equivalent of a modern-day Genghis Khan Tried to argue it was only entertainment, dawg Gangsta? Naw, courageous balls Had to change my style, they said I\\'m way too soft And I sound like AZ and Nas, out came the claws And the fangs been out since then But up until the instant that I\\'ve been against it It was ingrained in me that I wouldn\\'t amount to a shitstain I thought No wonder I had to unlearn everything my brain was taught Do I really belong in this game? I pondered I just wanna play my part, should I make waves or not? So back and forth in my brain the tug of war wages on And I don\\'t wanna seem ungrateful or disrespect the artform I was raised upon But sometimes you gotta take a loss And have people rub it in your face before you get made pissed off And keep pluggin\\', it\\'s your only outlet And your only outfit so you know they gonna talk about it Better find a way to counter it quick and make it, ah Feel like I\\'ve already said this a kabillion eighty times How many times can I say the same thing different ways that rhyme? What I really wanna say is, is there anyone else that can relate to my story? Bet you feel the same way I felt when I was in the same place you are I was afraid to Make a single sound Afraid I will never find a way out, out, out Afraid I never before I didn\\'t wanna go another round An angry man\\'s power will shut you up Trip wires fill this house with tip-toe love Run out of excuses with every word So here I am and I will not run Guts over fear, (The time is here) Guts over fear, (I shall not tear) For all the times I let you push me around And let you keep me down (Now I got) Guts over fear, guts over fear Feels like a close, it\\'s coming to Fuck am I gonna do? It\\'s too late to start over This is the only thing I, thing I know I know what it was like, I was there once, single parents Hate your appearance, did you struggle to find your place in this world? And the pain spawns all the anger on But it wasn\\'t until I put the pain in songs learned who to aim it on That I made a spark, started to spit hard as shit Learned how to harness it while the reins were off And there was a lot of bizarre shit, but the crazy part Was soon as I stopped saying \"I gave a fuck\" Haters started to appreciate my art And it just breaks my heart to look at all the pain I\\'ve caused But what am I gonna do when the rage is gone? And the lights go out in the trailer park? And the window that was closing and there\\'s nowhere else I can go with flows in And I\\'m frozen cause there\\'s no more emotion for me to pull from Just a bunch of playful songs that I made for fun So to the break of dawn here I go recycling the same, old song But I\\'d rather make \"Not Afraid 2\" than making another mothafuckin\\' \"We Made You\" uh Now I don\\'t wanna seem indulgent when I discuss my lows and my highs My demise and my uprise, pray to God I just opened enough eyes later on Gave you the supplies and the tools to hopefully use it to make you strong And enough to lift yourself up when you feel like I felt \\'Cause I can\\'t explain to y\\'all how dang exhausted my legs felt Just having to balance my damn self But on eggshells I was made to walk But thank you, ma, \\'cause that gave me the Strength to cause Shady-mania, so many empty that stadium At least I made it out of that house and a found a place in this world when the day was done So this is for every kid who all\\'s they ever did was dreamt that one day just getting accepted I represent him or her, anyone similar, you are the reason that I made this song Everything you\\'re scared to say don\\'t be afraid to say no more From this day on forward, just let them a-holes talk Take it with a grain of salt and eat their fucking faces off The legend of the angry blonde lives on through you when I\\'m gone And to think I was gone I was afraid to Make a single sound Afraid I will never find a way out, out, out Afraid I never before I didn\\'t wanna go another round An angry man\\'s power will shut you up Trip wires fill this house with tip-toe love Run out of excuses with every word So here I am and I will not run Guts over fear, (The time is here) Guts over fear, (I shall not tear) For all the times I let you push me around And let you keep me down (Now I got) Guts over fear, guts over fear A shimmy shimmy go go motherfuckin\\' pop It\\'s the K-K-Kid Rock with the K-K-Kid Rock shit

Try to understand, that I do want you as a fan I just don\\'t want you to do some crazy shit I seen this one shit on the news a couple weeks ago that made me sick Some dude was drunk and drove his car over a bridge And had his girlfriend in the trunk, and she was pregnant with his kid And in the car they found a tape, but they didn\\'t say who it was to Come to think about, his name was, it was you Damn! Mom I know I let you down And though you say the days are happy Why is the power off, and I\\'m fucked up? And mom, I know he\\'s not around But don\\'t you place the blame on me As you pour yourself another drink and I guess we are who we are Headlights shining in the dark night, I drive on Maybe we took this too far I went in headfirst Never thinking about who what I said hurt, in what verse My mom probably got it the worst The brunt of it, but as stubborn as we are Did I take it too far? Cleaning out my closet and all them other songs But regardless I don\\'t hate you \\'cause ma! You\\'re still beautiful to me, cause you\\'re my mom Though far be it for you to be calling, my house was Vietnam Desert Storm and both of us put together Can form an atomic bomb equivalent to chemical warfare And forever we can drag this on and on But, agree to disagree That gift from me up under the Christmas tree don\\'t mean shit to me You\\'re kicking me out? It\\'s fifteen degrees and it\\'s Christmas Eve (little prick just leave) Ma, let me grab my fucking coat, anything to have each other\\'s goats Why we always at each others throats? Especially when dad, he fucked us both We\\'re in the same fucking boat, you\\'d think that it\\'d make us close (nope) Further away that drove us, but together headlights shine, a car full of belongings Still got a ways to go, back to grandma\\'s house it\\'s straight up the road And I was the man of the house, the oldest, so my shoulders carried the weight of the load Then Nate got taken away by the state at eight years old, and That\\'s when I realized you were sick and it wasn\\'t fixable or changeable And to this day we remained estranged and I hate it though, but I guess we are who we are Headlights shining in the dark night I drive on Maybe we took this too far \\'Cause to this day we remain estranged and I hate it though \\'Cause you ain\\'t even get to witness your grand baby\\'s growth But I\\'m sorry mama for \\'Cleaning Out My Closet\\', at the time I was angry Rightfully maybe so, never meant that far to take it though, \\'cause Now I know it\\'s not your fault, and I\\'m not making jokes That song I no longer play at shows and I cringe every time it\\'s on the radio And I think of Nathan being placed in a home And all the medicine you fed us And how I just wanted you to taste your own, but Now the medications taken over and your mental states deteriorating slow And I\\'m way too old to cry, that shit\\'s painful though But ma, I forgive you, so does Nathan yo All you did, all you said, you did your best to raise us both Foster care, that cross you bare, few may be as heavy as yours But I love you Debbie Mathers, oh what a tangled web we have, \\'cause One thing I never asked was where the fuck my deadbeat dad was Fuck it I guess he had trouble keeping up with every address But I\\'d have flipped every mattress, every rock and desert cactus Own a collection of maps and followed my kids to the edge of the atlas Someone ever moved them from me? That you could bet your ass\\'s If I had to come down the chimney dressed as Santa, kidnap them And although one has met their grandma Once you pulled up in our drive one night as we were leaving to get some hamburgers Me, her and Nate, we introduced you, hugged you And as you left I had this overwhelming sadness come over me As we pulled off to go our separate paths, and I saw your headlights as I looked back And I\\'m mad I didn\\'t get the chance to thank you for being my Mom and my Dad So Mom, please accept this as a tribute I wrote this on the jet I guess I had to get this off my chest, I hope I get the chance to lay it before I\\'m dead The stewardess said to fasten my seat belt, I guess we\\'re crashing So if I\\'m not dreaming, I hope you get this message that I\\'ll always love you from afar \\'Cause you\\'re my mama I guess we are who we are Headlights shining in the dark night I drive on Maybe we took this too far I want a new life One without a cause So I\\'m coming home tonight Well no matter what the cost And if the plane goes down Or if the crew can\\'t wake me up Just know that I was alright And I was not afraid to die Oh even if there\\'s songs to sing My children will carry me Just know that I\\'m alright I was not afraid to die Because I put my faith in my new girl So I never say goodbye cruel world Just know that I\\'m alright I am not afraid to die I guess we are who we are Headlights shining in the dark night I drive on Maybe we took this too far, I want a new life Hi!

other out And date each other Some, something, something, something Something, something, something, something, I dunno Fuck it I can feel the heat rising Everything is on fire Today is a painful reminder of why We can only get brighter The further you put it behind ya But right now I\\'m on the inside Lookin out, cause I\\'m standing in the flames It\\'s a beautiful kind of pain Setting fire to yesterday Find the light, find the light, find the light I\\'m standing in the flames It\\'s a beautiful kind of pain Setting fire to yesterday Find the light, find the light, find the light Yesterday was the tornado warning, today is like the morning after Your world is torn in half, you wake and let\\'s wait to start the morning process Rebuilding and you\\'re still a work in progress Today is a whole new chapter, it\\'s like an enormous ass The thunderstorm has passed ya Your weather didn\\'t poke his eyes out with the thorn bush that you Used to smell the roses, stopped to inhale can\\'t even tell your nose is stuffed So focused on the brightside, then you floor the gas pedal And hit the corner fast, the more asserted Never looking back, may hit the curb But everyday is a new learning curve, as you, steer through life Sometimes you might not wanna swerve But you have to to avert a disaster, lucky, no permanent damage Cause they hurt you so bad, it\\'s like they murdered your ass And threw dirt on your casket, but you returned from the ashes And that hurt that you have, you just converted to gasoline And while you\\'re burning the past, standing at inferno and chant I\\'m standing in the flames It\\'s a beautiful kind of pain Setting fire to yesterday Find the light, find the light, find the light I\\'m standing in the flames It\\'s a beautiful kind of pain Setting fire to yesterday Find the light, find the light, find the light So familiarize with what having to swallow this pill is like It happens all the time, they take your heart and steal your life And it\\'s as though you feel you\\'ve died because you\\'ve been killed inside But yet you\\'re still alive which means you must survive Although today you may weep because you\\'re weak and Everything seems so bleak and hopeless The light that you\\'re seeking, it begins to seep in That\\'s the only thing keepin\\' you from leapin\\' off the motherfreaking deep in And I\\'m pulling for you to push through this feeling And with a little time that should do the healin\\' And by tomorrow you may even feel so good that you\\'re willing To forgive them even after all that shit you been put through This feeling of resilience is building and the flames are burning Quick as fire would through this building, you\\'re sealed in But you\\'re fireproof and retardant you withstood it And as you climb up to the roof you\\'re just chillin\\' and you look down Cause you\\'re so over them you could put the heel of your foot through the ceilin\\' As time passes, things change everyday But wounds, wounds heal But scars still remaining the same But tomorrow today\\'s goin\\' down in flames Throw the match at the passed up place So feel the fire beneath your feet As you barely even perspire from the heat Exhale deep and breathe a sigh of relief And as you say goodbye to the grief It\\'s like watching the walls melt in your prison cell But you\\'ve extinguished this living hell Still a little piece of you dies, you scream I\\'m standing in the flames It\\'s a beautiful kind of pain Setting fire to yesterday Find the light, find the light, find the light I\\'m standing in the flames It\\'s a beautiful kind of pain Setting fire to yesterday Find the light, find the light, find the light Feel the burn, watch the smoke as I turn Rising, a phoenix from the flames With wings I will fly I\\'m standing in the flames It\\'s a beautiful kind of pain Setting fire to yesterday Find the light, find the light, find the light I\\'m standing in the flames It\\'s a beautiful kind of pain Setting fire to yesterday Find the light, find the light, find the light Y\\'all know me, still the same O.G. but I been low-key Hated on by most these niggas with no cheese, no deals and no G\\'s No wheels and no keys, no boats, no snowmobiles, and no skis Mad at me cause I can finally afford to provide my family with groceries Got a crib with a studio and it\\'s all full of tracks to

heart to heart, left right left We all fall down, Step by step, heart to heart, left right left We all fall down like toy soldiers Bit by bit, torn apart We never win but the battle wages on for toy soldiers I\\'m suppose to be the soldier, who never blows his composure Even though I hold the weight of the whole world on my shoulders I ain\\'t never suppose to show it, my crew ain\\'t suppose to know it Even if it means going toe to toe with the Benzino, it don\\'t matter I never drag \\'em in battles that I can handle less I absolutely have to I\\'m suppose to set an example, I need to be the leader My crew looks for me to guide \\'em If some shit ever just pop off I\\'m suppose to be beside \\'em That Ja shit, I tried to squashed it, it was too late to stop it There\\'s a certain line, you just don\\'t cross it, and he crossed it I heard him say Hailie\\'s name on a song and I just lost it It was crazy, this shit went way beyond some Jay Z and Nas shit And even though the battle was won, I feel like we lost it I spent so much energy on it, honestly I\\'m exhausted I\\'m so caught it I almost feel like I\\'m the one who caused it This ain\\'t what I\\'m in Hip Hop for, it\\'s not why I got in it That was never my object for someone to get killed Why would I want to destroy something I helped build It wasn\\'t my intentions, my intentions were good I went through my whole career with out ever mentioning And that\\'s just outta respect, for not running my mouth And talking about something that I knew nothing about Plus Dre told me stay out, just wasn\\'t my beef, So I did I just fell back, watched and gritted my teeth while he\\'s all over TV Now I\\'m talking a man who literally saved my life, like fuck it I understand, this is business and this shit just isn\\'t none of my business But still knowing this shit could pop off at any minute cause Step by step, heart to heart, left right left We all fall down, like toy soldiers Bit by bit, torn apart We never win but the battle wages on for toy soldiers It used to be a time when you could just say a rhyme And wouldn\\'t have to worry about one of your people dying But now it\\'s elevated cause once you put someone\\'s kids in it Shit gets escalated, it ain\\'t just words no more, is it It\\'s a different ball game, call names and you ain\\'t just rapping We actually tried to stop the 50 and Ja beef from happening Me and Dre had sat with him, kicked it and had a chat with him And asked him not to start it, he wasn\\'t gonna go after him Until Ja\\' start yappin\\' in magazines how he stabbed him Fuck \\'em 50, smash him, mash him, and let him have it Meanwhile my intentions pulled me in other directions Some receptionist said the source who answers phones at his desk Has an erection for me and thinks That I\\'ll be his resurrection Tries to blow the dust of his mic and make a new record But now he\\'s fucked the game up cause one of the ways I came up Was through that publication, the same one that made me famous Now the owner of it got a grudge against me for nothing but fuck it That motherfucker can get it too, fuck \\'em then But I\\'m so busy being pissed off, I don\\'t stop to think That we just inherited 50\\'s beef with Murder Inc And he\\'s inherited mine, which is fine, ain\\'t like either of us mind We still have soldiers that\\'s on the front line that\\'s willing to die for us As soon as we give the orders, never to extort us Strictly to show they support us Maybe shout \\'em out in a rap or up in a chorus to show we love \\'em back And to let \\'em know how important it is to have Runyon Avenue soldiers up in our corners Their loyalty to us is worth more then any award is But I ain\\'t trying to have none of my people hurt or murdered It ain\\'t worth it, I can\\'t think of a perfecter way to word it Then to just say that I love y\\'all too much to see the verdict I\\'ll walk away from it all before I\\'ll let it go any further But don\\'t get it twisted, it\\'s not a plea that I\\'m coping I\\'m just willing to be the bigger man If y\\'all can quit popping off at the jaws with the knocking \\'Cause frankly I\\'m sick of talking I\\'m not gonna let someone else\\'s coffin rest on my conscience \\'cause Step by step, heart to heart, left right left We all fall down, like toy soldiers Bit by bit, torn apart We never win but the
